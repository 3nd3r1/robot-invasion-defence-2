-   Towers have different weapons and abilities, so you need to select towers that are best suited to the attacks you are facing. Some towers specialize in attacking certain types of enemies, while others may be more effective in specific situations.

    For example, the "Red Cannon" is most effective against "ARCHIE" robots.

-   Rounds start automatically, and waves of robots will enter the field, attempting to attack your structures. You must prevent them from reaching the end of the path by destroying them with your towers.

-   With each round, the robots become stronger and their numbers increase. You can build more defense structures to withstand the attacks.

-   Destroying robots earns you money, which you can use to buy additional towers.
    If a robot reaches the end of the path, you lose lives.
    Your money, lives, and current round number are displayed in the top bar of the view.
